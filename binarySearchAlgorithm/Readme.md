1. Binary search algorithm

Have you ever heard the proverb, “finding a needle in a haystack.” This program is designed to do just that- by using a binary search algorithm. You can create a random list of  numbers between 0 to 100, with every succeeding number having a difference of 2 between them.
When the user inputs a random number, the program will check if that number is included in the list. It will do so by creating two halves of the list. If the program finds the number in the first half of the list, it will eliminate the other half and vice versa. The search will continue until the program finds the number input of the user or until the subarray size becomes 0 (this means that the number is not in the list). This Node project idea will help you create an implement an algorithm that searches for an element in a list.
